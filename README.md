## Deployment

_**Remark:**_ credentials (like username and password, ssh keys or tokens) are needed to deploy packages. The helper scripts are created to support automated deployment but do not contain any credentials.

* Docker: to create docker images, use `bin/create-docker-image.sh`.
* Release packages: use `bin/release.sh` to tag the version and push it to the main branch. Additionally create images and packages and publish them to repositories.
